                The Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) highly values
                the precision of reaching target apogee, which for our category was 10,000 ft.
                Over/under achieving the height would cost points during competition.
                Therefore in order to capitalize on this rule our recovery team developed a
                clever design to partially control aerodynamic forces through the use of an…

            <p>Abstract This paper uses Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to analyze the
                deflection and failure criteria of a steel railroad bridge.
                This was done by first writing a code in MATLAB to determine
                the displacements at specific points (nodes) on one side of
                the bridge when a downward static load of 110000 lbf was applied equally…
