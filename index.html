        <h2> Creating a Mesh for CFD Analysis on Rocket Air-Brakes Using Gmsh</h2>
        <img src="img/mesh_1.png" width="600" alt="">
        <p>The Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) highly values 
            the precision of reaching target apogee, which for our category was 10,000 ft. 
            Over/under achieving the height would cost points during competition. 
            Therefore in order to capitalize on this rule our recovery team developed a 
            clever design to partially control aerodynamic forces through the use of an…

        <h2>Finite Element Analysis of a Railroad Bridge (Using MATLAB and ANSYS) - MCG 4102</h2>
        <img src="img/fea_1.png" alt="">
        <p>Abstract This paper uses Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to analyze the 
            deflection and failure criteria of a steel railroad bridge. 
            This was done by first writing a code in MATLAB to determine 
            the displacements at specific points (nodes) on one side of 
            the bridge when a downward static load of 110000 lbf was applied equally…

        <p>In order to improve my C++ skills and also learn

        <p>
            Background The uOttawa Rocketry team wanted to re-design the rocket motor 
            test stand due to the problems we faced while testing on it. The problems 
            were that the weight was too heavy so transporting it was difficult. The 
            test stand was made as a proprietary portion to our first hybrid engine

        <p>
            The uOttawa Rocketry team was founded in Summer, 2016. My colleagues and 
            I planned to design and fabricate a hybrid-propellant rocket for a competition 
            called the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC). IREC is held 
            in Utah and universities from around the world participate in it each year. 
            Before beginning a design encompassing all parts of…
