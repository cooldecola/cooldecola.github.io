    <h2 class="article-Title">Creating a Mesh for CFD Analysis on Rocket Air-Brakes Using Gmsh</h2>
    <img src="img/mesh_1.png" width="600" alt="">
    <p>The Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) highly values
        the precision of reaching target apogee, which for our category was 10,000 ft.
        Over/under achieving the height would cost points during competition.
        Therefore in order to capitalize on this rule our recovery team developed a
        clever design to partially control aerodynamic forces through the use of an…

    <h2 class="article-Title">Finite Element Analysis of a Railroad Bridge (Using MATLAB and ANSYS) - MCG 4102</h2>
    <img src="img/fea_1.png" alt="">
    <p>Abstract This paper uses Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to analyze the
        deflection and failure criteria of a steel railroad bridge.
        This was done by first writing a code in MATLAB to determine
        the displacements at specific points (nodes) on one side of
        the bridge when a downward static load of 110000 lbf was applied equally…

    <h2 class="article-Title">Building the Recovery System of a Rocket</h2>
    <img src="img/rec_sys_cover.PNG" width="500" alt="">
    <p>The University of Ottawa Rocket Team is a relatively new team at uOttawa
        and we competed in the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition
        (IREC) for the first time in June 2018 placing 17th out of 48 teams
        in our specific division, which was the 10,000 ft-COTS (commercially off the shelf).
        The part that I was responsible…

    <img src="img/cfd_1.png" alt="">
    <p>In order to improve my C++ skills and also learn
        more about computational methods I decided to take on a small project
        to conduct a heat transfer simulation using the finite difference method
        in C++. I decided to use a simple square geometry and made the following
        assumptions: System is steady…

    <img src="img/hybrid_prop.png" width="600" alt="">
    <p>
        The uOttawa Rocketry team was founded in Summer, 2016. My colleagues and
        I planned to design and fabricate a hybrid-propellant rocket for a competition
        called the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC). IREC is held
        in Utah and universities from around the world participate in it each year.
        Before beginning a design encompassing all parts of…
