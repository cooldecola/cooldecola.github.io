        <h1>Designing and Making a Hybrid Engine for a Rocket</h1>

        <p>The uOttawa Rocketry team was founded in Summer, 2016. My
            colleagues and I planned to design and fabricate a
            hybrid-propellant rocket for a competition called the
            Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC).
            IREC is held in Utah and universities from around the
            world participate in it each year. Before beginning a
            design encompassing all parts of the rocket we decided
            to design and build the engine first, since it is the main
            component of the rocket. In the next section I will give a
            brief introduction to hybrid-propellant rockets and what our
            goals were in terms of fabricating the engine.
        </p>

        <h1>Hybrid-Propellant Rocket Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hybrid Rocket engines are reliant on motors that are composed
            of a solid fuel and a liquid oxidizer. This is unlike solid
            or liquid rocket engines where both fuel and oxidizer are
            either solid or liquid.
        </p>

        <figcaption>The different configurations of the types of rockets</figcaption>

        <p>The above figure shows a classic hybrid rocket engine on the far
            right. This is the type of engine our team was aiming to make.
            Upon further research we found that the major components we
            needed to think about design-wise were the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Oxidizer Choice</li>
            <li>Fuel Choice and Fuel Core</li>
            <li>Control Valve</li>
            <li>Injector</li>
            <li>Nozzle</li>
            <li>Combustion Chamber</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="hybrid_engine/p2.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>A schematic showing the internals of the hybrid-propellant rocket</figcaption>

        <h1>Oxidizer Choice</h1>
        <p>We chose Nitrous Oxide (N2O) as the oxidizer because of it’s
            accessibility, safety and its wide use among student teams.
            We explored other oxidizers such as liquid oxygen, hydrogen
            peroxide, Peroxide (HTP) and RFNA but quickly realized that
            they would be either too difficult to obtain or too dangerous
            to use. Upon doing some further research we found that N2O is
            slightly sub-critical at room temperature and pressure. This
            means that when N2O is enclosed in a tank it can coexist as
            both liquid and vapor. When the tank valve is opened, changes
            in pressure causes the liquid N_2O to boil off and the increase
            in vapor keeps the tank pressure relatively stable
            (self-pressurization). The willingness for N_2O to keep the
            tank self-pressurized implies that our injector plate can be
            crudely designed to still work effectively. Other gases that
            can’t self-pressurize are at risk of back-flow; where the
            pressure inside the tank reduces substantially causing the
            combustion to flow back into the oxidation tank and potentially
            cause an explosion. There was one downside however in choosing
            N2O which relates to N2O’s density. We wanted to use the liquid
            portion of N2O , but due to it’s density, it falls to the bottom
            of the tank and gives us uneasy access to it. The way we went
            around this problem will be discussed in the Nitrous Oxide Test
            Stand section. </p>

        <h1>Fuel Choice and Fuel Core</h1>
        <p>Paraffin, also known as candle wax, was our choice for fuel. Paraffin as a fuel has a couple of benefits and
            it is listed here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Paraffin is extremely stable making it less hazardous</li>
            <li>Relatively low melting temperature allows us to easily shape paraffin into the fuel core</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The process we decided to use when fabricating the fuel grain involved melting the paraffin in a water bath
            and then slowly pouring paraffin into an ABS pipe while keeping a smaller pipe rotating in the center. The
            smaller pipe enables the grain to have the inner diameter it needs to allow the oxidizer to flow through.
        </p>

        <figcaption>Shaping paraffin into it's fuel core shape</figcaption>

        <h1>Control Valves and Injector Plate</h1>
        <p>The flow of N2O will dictate the rate of combustion and
            therefore control is important. We decided to use a solenoid
            valve because they can be controlled remotely as they work
            through electricity and no mechanical components are needed.
            We used CGA-326 valve which are safe for nitrous oxide use
            and will also work with the nitrous oxide tank fitting that
            we have. Designing and building the injector plate was
            relatively easy to do. As discussed before, the self
            pressurizing and regulating feature of the N2O allowed us
            to have a simple design.
        </p>

        <img src="hybrid_engine/p4.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Injector Plate Design</figcaption>

        <p>We drilled twenty-four 0.05118′ outlets into the injector plate as can be seen in the image above. This
            allowed atomization of N2O. The following is a cold flow test of N2O through the injector plate</p>

        <h1>Nozzle</h1>

        <p>We were able to design the nozzle using rocket equations. After choosing the output flow we wanted (Mach 1 at
            the throat) we were able to determine nozzle throat area, exit area and subsequently the rest of the
            geometry.</p>

        <img src="hybrid_engine/p5.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Our nozzle design</figcaption>

        <p>After determining the nozzle dimensions we were able to determine combustion chamber dimensions as well.</p>
        <img src="hybrid_engine/p6.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Combustion Chamber (fuel core) design</figcaption>

        <p>The nozzle would be attached to the combustion chamber through 6 quarter inch bolts.</p>

        <h1>Nitrous Oxide Tank Stand</h1>
        <p>As mentioned previously the need to access the liquid portion of the oxidizer tank posed a challenge for the
            team. The way we resolved this problem is by building a stand that would orient the tank 60 degrees from the
            vertical. A schematic of the design is shown below</p>

        <img src="hybrid_engine/p7.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Design of our N20 tank stand</figcaption>

        <p>We build the stand using plywood and wood glue. We used strap buckles to prevent the tank from sliding off.
            The following image shows our completed stank with the tank</p>

        <img src="hybrid_engine/p9.png" alt="">

        <h1>Test Stand</h1>
        <p>Test stands for rocket engines can either be vertically oriented or horizontally. Ours was horizontal. The
            image below shows our design which was made of large planks of wood nailed together to provide an even
            elevated surface for the motor to rest on. A thin layer of sheet metal was bolted on from the top to provide
            protection and have a stronger foundation for the railings and subsequent stopper that needed to be bolted
            into the table.</p>

        <img src="hybrid_engine/p10.png" alt="">

        <p>The image below shows a linear rail system an aluminum platform mounted on to it (allowing sliding). To the
            platform the motor was bolted down using a pair of 3 aluminum made clamps.</p>

        <img src="hybrid_engine/p11.png" alt="">

        <p>The configuration of the test stand to the motor is as follows:</p>

        <img src="hybrid_engine/p12.png" alt="">

        <p>For a clearer idea of how the system worked please refer to this image of the unfinished test stand to get a
            clearer visualization</p>

        <img src="hybrid_engine/p13.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>Unfinished test stand</figcaption>

        <p>On the stopper, which prevented the engine from flying off the rails when turned on, we attached a load cell
            which recorded thrust measurements. All in all, the following image is our final setup before testing</p>
